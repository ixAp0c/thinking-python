# thinking-python
A repository for storing personal solutions to the exercises contained in [Think Python, 2nd Edition] by Allen Downey. Also
includes some script examples from various sections.

Will keep updated by chapter for now, until the projects get longer.

Feel free to use any code for educational purposes.
