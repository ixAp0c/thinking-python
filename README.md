## thinking-python
A repository for storing personal solutions to the exercises contained in [Think Python, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). Also includes some example scripts.

Exercises are denoted by Chapter / Exercise Number (so 3-1 is Chapter 3; Exercise 1), and example scripts are denoted by section number, so example 3-5 is from section 3.5

Will keep updated by chapter for now, until the projects get longer.

Feel free to use any code for educational purposes.
