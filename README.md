## thinking-python
A repository for storing personal solutions to the exercises contained in [Think Python, 2nd Edition] by Allen Downey. Also
includes some script examples from various sections.

Exercises are denoted by Chapter / Exercise Number (so 3-1 is Chapter 3; Exercise 1).

Will keep updated by chapter for now, until the projects get longer.

Feel free to use any code for educational purposes.
